## Introduction
**Me**dia R**econ**ciler, or simply _mecon_, is a cross-platform command line tool which reconciles media within a directory with media in a Plex library. It helps answer simple questions such as:
- Given a list of files in a directory, which ones have failed to have been added to a Plex library?
- Given a list of files in a directory, which ones exist in a Plex library?
